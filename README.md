# Whole Genome CRISPR Analysis
Analysis of Whole Genome CRISPR screening in high-grade serous ovarian cancers
created early stage models of fallopian tube epithelial cells carrying both TP53 and BRCA1 pathogenic mutations and then used whole genome CRISPR screening of 19,500 genes targets in these models to identify genes associated with early stage neoplasia![image](https://github.com/koushik20/Whole_Genome_CRISPR_Analysis/assets/57368663/b24c8304-c49f-40c8-9d06-9c0fbd7ef029)
